# Capstone instructions!

To begin you must create a Flask venv and activate it.
Once completed go to the folder directory containing "venv_requirements.txt" and run a pip install to install all necessary modules.
Then using that environment you must run "create_db.py".

You can now view and use the environment!

For MySQL Workbench you must go to the tractortek schema and use the import wizard to import specific table csv's.
The csv's are: hist_prod_sales.csv, hist_serv_sales.csv, prod_details.csv, sales_team.csv, week_breakdown.csv.
Whilst you are there you can view the "CapEER" diagram!

Once completed you can the run the MySQL "TractortekScript". It will create the rest of the relevant tables.

To full experience the capstone at this point you may need to download a ODBC driver to link the OLTP table to excel.

Once this is completed you are fully operational and can use/view all the features in the Capstone.

The Excel Workbook contains 3 dashboards and several relative tables for data visualization.

Enjoy!
